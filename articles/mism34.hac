                What You Should Know About Collection Agencies                 "Cosmopolitan" (November 1984) pp 136-143     Karen Hartney laughed when she pulled the lavishly  illustrated  book onGalapagos Islands wildflowers out of her  mailbox.   She  hadn't ordered  thebook, wasn't about to pay for it, and  felt   no  obligation  to  go  to  thetrouble and expense of returning it.     Two weeks later, she was billed $29.95,  plus mailing and handling.  Shethrew the statement in  the  trash.     In  time,  the  letters  grew  nasty,demanding payment and warning that her  credit rating  would  suffer  if  shedidn't respond promptly.  When a collection agent began  calling her at work,she snapped.     "Leave me  alone,"  Karen  hissed.   "I  never  wanted  that  dumb  bookanyway!"     "You might  have thought of that before you decided to keep it," the manresponded.  "I think  the  word  for  taking  things  that  aren't  yours  is'stealing.'"     Karen  (whose name has been changed)  was furious--  but  also  worried.Could the collection agency harm her credit  rating,  contact  her  employer,neighbors, landlord?  Most of all, she just wanted the  harassing  calls  andletters to stop.   Though  resentful,  she  mailed the  payment--  now a full$37.50, including interest and collection charges.     Karen's case is not an isolated one.   Despite the strong  new  consumerprotection laws passed in recent years,  abuses still exist,  and  a sizeableminority  of  retailers  and  collection  agencies  engage  in  such  illegalcollection practices.   Charging for unordered goods is only one of the  manyactivities that are prohibited by federal law.  (If, by the way,  you receiveunrequested merchandise as Karen did, you are under  no  obligation  to  pay.You may treat it as a free gift,   but  you  should  notify  the  sender,  inwriting, of your intention as soon as you receive a "bill".)     The thorniest problems occur when a debt is truly owed and  a  consumer,through overextension or inadvertence, falls behind in paying it.    In  thiscase,  the account is often  turned over to a collection  agency,  which  maybehave unethically in its effort to recoup the money.     "Some of the most  extreme  cases  we  see  involve  actual  threats  ofviolence," reports Diane Conner,  staff attorney  for  the  Credit  PracticesDivision of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).   "Children  have  been  toldover the phone,  'Tell your parents they're  going  to  jail  tomorrow  if wedon't get the money.'    We've also heard about collection agencies trying toadd on illegal fees of up to 100 percent of the original debt."     Federal law protects you against such abusive  practices.    By  knowingwhich tactics are illegal and how  to  stop  them,  you  can  avoid  being  avictum.BEYOND THE LEGAL LIMIT______________________________________________________     The following are violations of consumer protection laws:     REPETITIVE CALLING OR CALLS AT UNUSUAL TIMES OR PLACES.  Some collectionagents will call a consumer repeatedly during  a  single  day,  or  telephonelate at night without permission--  both of which are clearly  illegal  underthe Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA).     Calls at work are not considered "harassing" if an office  is  the  mostconvenient place for you to receive the call-- but, says  Diane  Conner,  "Ifthe agent knows that your employer does not allow  you  to  receive  personalcalls at work, or if you've asked not to be contacted there,  then  it  wouldbe a violation."     CALLS TO PERSONS OTHER THAN THE CONSUMER.    If a collection  agent  hasbusiness with you, you are the only person with  whom  he  may  discuss  thatbusiness.    "We frequently hear  that  a  collection  agent  has  called  anemployer,  or perhaps a neighbor,  and  left  an  "urgent message'  that  theconsumer should call XYZ Collection  Agency  regarding  payment  of  a debt,"reports Bill McDonough, an FTC staff attorney.   "The only motive would be toembarass the consumer, and it's against the law."     ABUSIVE, OBSCENE, OR THREATENING LANGUAGE.   Late bill payers have  beencalled deadbeats and bums, subjected to rude and  obscene language, and givenveiled as well as direct threats of  violence  and  imprisonment.    If  thishappens,  end the conversation immediately,  requesting  that  you  never  becontacted again.    Follow up with a brief letter barring future contact withthe collection agency.    You may then wish to file a complaint with the  FTCor state consumer protection agency, or pursue private legal action.     MISLEADING THREATS OF LEGAL ACTION.  No one has the right to make  falsethreats or to claim that legal action has been or is about to  be  institutedif that's not the case.  Also prohibited are papers that look  like  officialnotices from a state agency  or  court  of  law--  including  documents  withheadings that mimic a common legal  form  (such as  "Ace Collection Agency v.Jane Consumer") or ones that use an agency name similar to that of a state orfederal agency.     OTHER ABUSIVE BEHAVIOR.    Because  debt   collectors   show   infiniteingenuity, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act  covers  scores  of  otherforbidden tricks,  from tacking on  collection  charges  not  authorized  bycontract or law,  to using false names and  publishing lists of consumers indebt.   Realizing that it could not forsee every  possible  abuse,  Congresseven added a prohibition against any  "harassing,  oppressive,  and  abusiveconduct"--  a general phrase that increases the power of the courts and  theFederal  Trade  Commission  to  protect  you  against  improper   collectionpractices.STEPS TOWARD SELF-DEFENSE____________________________________________________     What can you do if you're the victum of an overeager collection  agency?Your first and simplest option under the FDCPA is to request in writing  thatall collection contacts stop.   Once you do that,  the collection  agency  isnot allowed to call or write to demand payment;  it can only  advise  you  ofnew action, such as the referring of your account back  to  the  creditor  orthe filing of legal action.     if the harassment  continues,   you  may  wish  to  contact  your  stateconsumer agency.    According  to  Cyra  Narva  of  the  Consumer  AssistanceDivision of the Massachusetts State Banking Department,  these agencies  willoften intervene  to  solve  the  problem.    "Usually,"  Narva reports,  "theconsumer is content  just to know that the rug has been pulled out from underthe collection agency and that the abusive practices will stop."     The agencies won't compensate you for their past  harassment;  however asuccessful lawsuit might.    You could bring suit under  the  FDCPA  and,  ifsuccessful,  recover a cash judgement of actual damages suffered,  attorney'sfees, sourt costs,  and a special statutory  award  of  up  to  one  thousanddollars.     "If a consumer has been truly  injured,"  says  Willard  Ogburn,  deputydirector of the National Consumer  Law  Center,  "he or she is entitled to becompensated.   The fact that attorney's fees may be recovered in a successfulcase encourages  some attorneys to pursue strong cases on a commission basis,while the possibility of an  extra  statutory  award  of  up  to  a  thousanddollars acts as an extra incentive to the consumer.   Meanwhile,  the  publicinterest is served as  collection  agencies  learn  that  violating  consumerprotection laws can be very expensive."     Whatever decision you make,  you're sure to reap some gratification fromsimply standing up for your  rights  and  the  rights  of  others  like  you.Rudeness and abuse need never be tolerated,  and  you  can  see  to  it  thatthey're not.+----------------------------------+    +-----------------------------------+|        STOPPING TROUBLE          |    |    CONSUMER AGENCIES  THAT CAN    ||        BEFORE IT STARTS          |    |     HELP YOU PROTECT YOURSELF     ||                                  |    |                                   ||     Healthy credit use  is  not  |    |  THE  FEDERAL  TRADE  COMMISSION  ||  inconsistent    with     sound  |    |  (FTC).
