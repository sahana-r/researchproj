  by Rick Arnold
  
  It's a sad fact that a sign of our times is the frequency of eating 
disorders diagnosed in our youth -- a very serious illness if left 
untreated. One in ten (1 in 10) Americans, usually adolescents, die 
from various eating disorders, recognized by the National Institute 
of Mental Health. Nearly five percent of the population (figures from 
NIMH) suffer from *anorexia nervosa* and/or *bulimia nervosa*, with 
millions of others suffering from *binge eating*.

  The needless deaths of those with anorexia and bulimia, need not
occur, if family members and friends would help by recognizing the
problems and encourage the person to seek treatment. 

  *Anorexia nervosa* is a disorder where a person intentionally starves
themselves. The disorder, usually starts when the person reaches puberty,
and involves extreme weight loss -- at least fifteen percent (15%) below
an individual's normal body weight. This, in an effort to look and feel
the way they believe is the "normal" appearance for a person in their
peer group. Some suffering from anorexia will appear pale and emaciated
but feel they are overweight, and need to lose more weight to be acceptable 
in appearance. This can lead to hospitalization in an effort to prevent 
starvation.

  Their weight -- in particular -- and food become obsessions. The person's
compulsiveness is demonstrated by strange eating rituals or refusal to eat 
in front of others. Those with the disorder will often prepare extravagant
gourmet meals for family and friends, however will rarely partake of the
meals they have presented for the others. Often, they will have rigorous
and excessive exercise routines. A disruption or loss of the monthly
menstrual period is common for women with the disorder. Impotence often
affects men who have anorexia.

  *Bulimia nervosa* is quite dangerous, because the person frequently
uses an excessive amount of laxatives and/or diuretics, as the individual
purges their intake of calories and liquids attempting to lose weight. A
more drastic measure taken by these individuals is vomiting shortly after
eating. Frequently individuals use all of these methods, and will not be
detected because they maintain above or near normal body weight. 

  Those with this disorder often binge excessively, then purge the their
intake using one or all the methods mentioned, from once or twice a week 
to several times a day. Excessive dieting between episodes of binging and 
purging is quite common. Nearly half of those with anorexia will eventually 
develop bulimia. This condition typically begins in adolescent women, but 
also is found in men. Often the victims of this disorder will not seek help 
until in their thirties or forties, and the condition is more difficult to 
cure, due to the deeply ingrained habits developed over time.

  A similar disorder to bulimia is *binge eating*, however the person will
not practice purging, and is usually overweight because of their compulsive
indulging in over eating binges.  People with this disorder usually have
a history of extreme weight fluctuations. Two percent (2%) of the general
population suffer from this ailment, and is predominantly found in women
more so than men. Nearly thirty percent (30%) of people in supervised
weight control programs suffer from binge eating.

  The following symptoms are common to these eating disorders:

       BN,   - Use of drugs for vomiting, bowel movements and urination
       BN,   - Food binging with no noticeable weight gain
       BN,   - Long periods of time spent in bathroom -- to induce vomiting
       BN, BE- Abuse of drugs and/or alcohol              
          
  The causes of eating disorders are complex and involve, personalities,
environments, genetics, and biochemistry of each individual. Shared traits
among those with eating disorders are: low self-esteem, feelings of help-
lessness, and fear of becoming fat. Those with anorexia tend to be good
students, excellent athletes, and *perfectionists*. They place a high
priority on pleasing others -- over their own needs and wishes. To gain a
sense of control in their lives, they restrict themselves to eating only
certain types of foods and only in limited amounts. This need for control
of their bodies serves a twofold purpose: fulfills the desire to please
others by being thin, therefore appealing; and allows *THEM* to have control
over someone -- even if it is themselves. 

  Binge eaters (most often bulimic) release stress through eating large 
quantities of food -- especially junk food -- in their effort to rebel, and
relieve anxiety; often in response to feeling dominated. The binging often
brings on guilt and depression after the impulsive behavior; and the
bulimic is more likely to engage in a risky life style of abuse for drugs
and alcohol. 

  Much of the cause for these eating disorders can be traced to an overly
concerned parent, who wishes their child to be physically attractive and
accepted by society. Parents or older siblings, who pursue activities such 
as dancing, athletics, or modeling, or professions where appearance is 
very important, often create an environment that causes an eating disorder
to develop in the younger child(ren).

  What can you do to help?  Often psychotherapy is needed -- depending on
the severity of the disorder, and how late it is discovered. Treatment can 
save the life of one with an eating disorder. Family members and friends 
can contact local hospitals or medical centers to find out specific 
information about eating disorders, how to cope with them and how to
provide support for the person who suffers from the illness. Even if the
person obtains treatment, support and understanding from friends and
family are needed to provide an environment conducive to wellness and 
recovery.

  The most helpful thing *YOU* can do, treat your children the way you
would like to be treated. As a parent, there will be times when sitting
at the supper table -- it is better to *bite* your tongue! `Spare the rod;
spoil the child' -- has some merit; perhaps it should be: spare the lashing
(tongue-lashing that is), and DO NOT denigrate your children.
