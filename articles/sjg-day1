Steve Jackson Games/Secret Service Lawsuit -- Day One

	AUSTIN -- Plaintiff's attorneys wrested two embarrassing 
admissions from the United States Secret Service on the opening day of a 
federal civil lawsuit designed to establish the bounds of constitutional 
protections for electronic publishing and electronic mail.
	In the first, Special Agent Timothy Foley of Chicago admitted that 
crucial statements were erroneous in an affidavit he used to conduct 
several search-and-seizure operations in a March 1990 crackdown on 
computer crime.
	Foley later conceded that the Secret Service's special training 
for computer crime investigators overlooks any mention of the law that 
regulates the extent of permissible search-and-seizures at publishing 
operations.
	The case, brought by Steve Jackson Games, an Austin firm, is being 
tried before United States District Judge Sam Sparks. Carefully nurtured 
over the course of three years by a group of electronic civil rights 
activists -- at a cost of more than $200,000 -- the case has been 
eagerly anticipated as a possible damper on what is seen as computer 
crime hysteria among federal police.
 	Plaintiffs hope to prove that the printed word exists just as 
surely on the computer screen as it does on a sheet of paper. The 
complaint also seeks to establish the right of computer users to 
congregate electronically on bulletin board systems -- such as one 
called Illuminati that was taken from Steve Jackson Games -- and to 
exchange private electronic mail on such BBSs.
	"This lawsuit is just to stand up and say, at the end of the 20th 
Century, that publishing occurs as much on computers as on the printed 
page," said Jim George, of the Austin firm George, Donaldson & Ford, 
Jackson's law firm. 
	That issue came into sharp focus during George's questioning of 
Foley regarding the seizure of the PC on which Illuminati ran, and 
another computer on which was stored the word processing document 
containing a pending Steve Jackson Games book release, GURPS Cyberpunk.
	"At the Secret Service computer crime school, were you, as the 
agent in charge of this investigation, made aware of special rules for 
searching a publishing company?" George asked Foley. He was referring to 
the Privacy Protection Act, which states that police may not seize a 
work in progress from a publisher. It does not specify what physical 
form such a work must take.
	"No, sir, I was not," Foley responded.
	"Did you just miss class the day that was taught?" George asked.
	"No, sir. The United States Secret Service does not teach its 
agents about special rules regarding search and seizure at publishing 
companies," Foley said.
	"Let the record clearly show that to be the case," George said.
	Earlier, Foley admitted on the witness stand that his original 
affidavit seeking a judge's approval to raid Steve Jackson Games 
contained a fundamental error.
	During the March 1990 raid -- one of several dozen staged that day 
around the country in an investigation that the Secret Service called 
Operation Sun Devil at the time -- agents were seeking copies of a 
document taken as a hacker trophy from BellSouth. Subsequently 
republished in an electronic magazine called Phrack, thousands of copies 
of the document were stored on bulletin board systems around the nation.
	Neither Jackson nor his company were suspected of wrongdoing, and 
no charges have ever been filed against anyone targeted in several 
Austin raids. The alleged membership of Steve Jackson employee Loyd 
Blankenship in the Legion of Doom hacker's group -- which was believed 
responsible for the break-in -- led agents to raid the Austin game 
publisher at the same time that Blankenship's Austin home was raided.
	Yet the only two paragraphs in the 42-paragraph indictment that 
established a connection between Blankenship's alleged illegal 
activities and Steve Jackson Games were shown to have been erroneously 
arrived at, when George produced a statement by Bellcore expert Henry 
Kluepfel disputing statements attributed to him in Foley's affidavit.
	"Is it true that Mr. Kluepfel logged onto (Illuminati)?" George 
questioned.
	"No, sir," Foley responded.
	"But you state that in your affidavit," George said.
	"That was a misattribution," Foley said.
	"So you had no knowledge that anything was sent to my client?"
	"No sir, not directly," Foley said.
	"Indirectly?" George asked.
	"No sir."
	The Justice Department, in papers filed with the court, contends 
that only traditional journalistic organizations enjoy the protections 
of the Privacy Protection Act. It further contends that users of 
electronic mail have no reasonable expectation of privacy.
	The trial was to resume at 8:30 a.m. It is expected to conclude on 
Thursday or Friday.
